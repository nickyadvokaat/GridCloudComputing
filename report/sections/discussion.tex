Discussion (recommended size: 1 page): summarize the main findings of your work and discuss the tradeoffs inherent in the design of cloud-computing-based applications.
Should the WantCloud CTO use IaaS-based clouds?
Among others, use extrapolation of the results as reported in Section 6.b of the report, to discuss the charged time and the charged cost for 100,000/1,000,000/10,000,000 users and for 1 day/1 month/1 year.

In the current version of the software, only one start and one terminate action is allowed per cleanup.
Thus, the software will scale machines by maximally two per minute either way.
Because of this, the reaction of the scaling component can be a bit slow, as can be seen in the results of our experiments.
To improve this, we can simply allow the load balancer to start or terminate more machines per cleanup.
This takes a bit more accounting, but should overall not be a big change.
We did not implement this because it requires some extra tweaking and we simply did not have the time.

Some parameters of the load balancer require some more experimentation or tweaking to perform optimally.
These are the load definition formula and the load that one machine can handle per 30 seconds.
