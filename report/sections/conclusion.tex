In conclusion, we built a cloud-computing-based application for solving Sudoku puzzles.
We have shown that the application performs well and that it scales up and down depending on the total workload on the system.

The application of solving solutions at the workloads that we tested does not seem very suitable for a cloud-computing-based solution, due to the high costs involved.
We note, however, that this could also be due to the parameters that we chose (causing the system to scale up faster than it should).
