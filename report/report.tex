\section{Introduction}

\lettrine[nindent=0em,lines=3]{O}ur customer WantCloud BV wants to develop an application in which users can solve Sudoku puzzles. One feature is the automatic completion of a partially filled in puzzle. To lower the client side workload this computation is performed on a remote server, our task is to create this server side application. The traditional approach is to buy server hardware and host the application on it. However this is time consuming, expensive, and scaling demands extra effort. Therefore such services are nowadays hosted on cloud computing services such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) in which provides virtual machines that can be dynamically allocated. So our problem can be defined as: how do we create a fast, reliable, elastic Sudoku solving application on an IaaS service?

Todo: the existing systems and/or tools (related work)

Our solution to the problem described is \appName, a fast and reliable cloud based Sudoku solver running on Amazon EC2\cite{ec2}. 
\appName features one main server to which all request are made, and a variable number of solver machines over which the jobs are distributed. \appName provides elasticity by automatically provisioning solver machine VM's according to workload, and is resistant to system failures of solver machines.

The remainder of this article is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the background of the application and its requirements. The system design including resource management architecture and system policies are presented in section 3. In section 4 we evaluate the performance of our system in production. Section 5 summarizes our main findings and discusses tradeoffs in our design. The 6$^{th}$ section concludes this paper. 

%------------------------------------------------

\section{Background on Application}
Background on Application (recommended size: 0.5 pages): describe the application (1 paragraph) and its requirements (1-3 paragraphs, summarized in a table if needed).

%------------------------------------------------

\section{System Design}
System Design (recommended size: 1.5 pages)
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Resource Management Architecture: describe the design of your system,
including the inter-operation of the provisioning, allocation, reliability, and monitoring components (which correspond to the homonym features required by the WantCloud CTO).
\item System Policies: describe the policies your system uses and supports. The latter may remain not implemented throughout your coursework, as long as you can explain how they can be supported in the future.
\item (Optional) Additional System Features: describe each additional feature of your system, one sub-section per feature.
\end{enumerate}

%------------------------------------------------

\section{Experimental Results}
Experimental Results (recommended size: 1.5 pages)
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Experimental setup: describe the working environments (DAS, Amazon EC2,
etc.), the general workload and monitoring tools and libraries, other tools and libraries you have used to implement and deploy your system, other tools and libraries used to conduct your experiments.
\item Experiments: describe the experiments you have conducted to analyze each system feature, then analyze them; use one sub-section per experiment. For each experiment, describe the workload, present the operation of the system, and analyze the results. In the analysis, report:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Charged-time = time that would have been charged using the Amazon EC2 timing approach (1-hour increments)
\item Charged-cost = cost that would have been charged using the 3
E
Amazon EC2 charging approach, assuming 10 Euro-cents/charged hour
\item Service metrics of the experiment, such as runtime and response time of
the service, etc.
\item (optional) Usage metrics of the experiment, such as per-VM and overall
system usage and activity.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

%------------------------------------------------

\section{Discussion}
Discussion (recommended size: 1 page): summarize the main findings of your work and discuss the tradeoffs inherent in the design of cloud-computing-based applications. Should the WantCloud CTO use IaaS-based clouds? Among others, use extrapolation of the results as reported in Section 6.b of the report, to discuss the charged time and the charged cost for 100,000/1,000,000/10,000,000 users and for 1 day/1 month/1 year.
