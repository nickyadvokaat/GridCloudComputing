Purposes/readers of a review:
=============================

There are different types of readers of a review of a paper, and they 
have different uses for the review:

1. the authors of the paper, who are interested in the assessment of
   the paper, and in particular, if the review contains criticisms,
   how they can repair these.

2. program committee members and chairmen, who need the reviews to
   base their accept/reject decisions on. They are also concerned 
   with potential disagreement among multiple reviewers of
   the same paper, and often have to deal with many (hundreds is
   no exception) papers and reviews in a short time.

3. editors of journals, who are to a large extent in the same position
   as program committee members and chairmen, with as main differences
   that they deal with submitted papers on an individual basis and so
   don't have to compare papers, and that they have the option to 
   request major or minor revisions of papers.

Keep in mind that when writing a review, you are judging work that may
have taken the authors months to do, and so they are entitled to a fair
and well-considered review that should not be done in a hurry, or be  
based on superficially scanning the paper. You are performing a service 
to the community, and of course, you're expecting fair and well-considered
reviews of your own papers in return! 


Structure of a review:
======================

1. An abstract of the paper in your own, including a concise problem
   statement and a summary of the results, which serves three purposes:
   a. it forces you to formulate what the actual topic and 
      contribution of the paper is
   b. it is a signal to the author(s) that you have actually read
      and understood the paper
   c. it can help the editor of the journal or the program committee to
      better understand the review and to reach a decision

2. A list of the main strengths of the paper. Examples are:
   a. "this is a very important and timely topic to work on"
   b. "this paper has a very strong and thorough experimental section"
   c. "this paper is really very well written"

3. A list of the main weaknesses of the paper. Examples are:
   a. "this result was already published in the CACM in 1961"
   b. "there is no motivation at all for the problem investigated"
   c. "this paper is very poorly written "
   d. "the paper is not very well structured in that ..."

The reasons for having these short lists of main strengths and weaknesses
is that the readers of reviews don't have to wade through long pieces
of texts in order to extract important issues. Especially when papers
are controversial and program committees have to deal with a large
number of submissions, this can make the selection process much more 
efficient.

Don't overdo things in 2. and 3. above, these are the main points! So
lists of 2-4 items are reasonable. Also try to be concise in these points,
but do explain them in more detail under 4. below (e.g., examples of
poor writing or structure). If you do so, do add "(see details below)"
to the strength or weakness as a forward reference.

4. Detailed comments. Examples are:
   a. "the abstract should include an indication of the results of the paper"
   b. "the legends in Figures 2 and 5 are too small to be read"
   c. "the authors may check and refer to the paper [authors/title/journal]"
   d. "formula (3) is incorrect because ..."
   e. "the paper is not very well structured in that Section N should be
       subdivided into subsections and that ..."

You can be pretty elaborate in the detailed comments (much more so than in the
examples above!!). Number the detailed comments for easy reference, e.g., when
multiple authors have to handle them. Try to group the detailed comments of
the same flavor (e.g., all presentational issues, or all issues related to
experiments or the like) in a numbered sublist so that at the top level, the list
of detailed comments does not run into more than say 7 items. When a detailed 
comment elaborates on a main strength or weakness, explicitly say so by
referring back to it.

Never say something like "There are many papers that have dealt with the same 
problem." without actually giving references that support this claim!

5. Numerical assessment. Usually, conferences ask for numerical assessments
of papers for such aspects as originality, technical content, and readability,
and for overall quality. If they don't, you may give such assessments anyway.
Some journals have lists of questions for reviewers that are usually of a 
more qualitative character.

In general, the better the conference or journal, the more thorough
and elaborate a review should be, although there are workshops in different
areas in computer science with tightly knit communities that take pride in
very thorough and extensive reviews.
